> *“Why do I need two different PowerShell modules just to manage Azure?”*

That’s the common frustration—**Az** and **Microsoft.Graph** are both official modules, but they serve completely different purposes. This post breaks down when to use each, with examples, a comparison matrix, and tips for choosing the right one.

---

## 🔍 What's the Difference?

- **Az** is for managing **Azure resources**—think subscriptions, VMs, networking, storage.
- **Microsoft.Graph** is for managing **Microsoft Entra ID** (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 identities—users, groups, licenses, directory roles.

They're both used in the Azure ecosystem, but they hit different APIs and serve different layers.

## 🧭 Comparison Matrix

| Feature / Action                             | `Az` Module             | `Microsoft.Graph` Module       | Use This When…                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Create/Manage VMs, Storage, etc.            | ✅ `Az.Compute`, etc.    | ❌                            | You’re managing Azure infrastructure.           |
| Create/Update Users & Groups in Entra ID    | ❌                      | ✅ `Microsoft.Graph.Users`     | You’re managing Entra identity objects.         |
| Assign RBAC Roles to Azure resources        | ✅                       | ✅ (via role assignments)      | Either works, but `Az` is more common.          |
| Create/Manage Subscriptions & Resource Groups | ✅ `Az.Resources`       | ❌                            | Managing the Azure structure itself.            |
| Assign Microsoft 365 licenses               | ❌                      | ✅ `Microsoft.Graph.Licenses`  | Working with SaaS identity entitlements.        |
| Use Azure Policy / ARM Templates            | ✅                       | ❌                            | Infrastructure governance and templates.        |
| Modify Conditional Access / Entra Policies  | ❌                      | ✅                             | Identity security config.                       |
| Read/Write Entra Group Memberships          | ❌                      | ✅                             | Directory group automation.                     |
| Automate Identity Lifecycle (HR sync, etc.) | ❌                      | ✅                             | Microsoft Graph is the only option.             |

## ✍️ Syntax Side-by-Side

### Create Resource Group (Az)

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "dev-rg" -Location "eastus"
```

### Create Entra User (Graph)

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All"
New-MgUser -DisplayName "Logphile Test" -UserPrincipalName "logtest@domain.com" -MailNickname "logtest" -AccountEnabled:$true -PasswordProfile @{
    Password = "SecurePass123!"
}
```

## 🧠 When You Might Use Both

Here’s a practical scenario:

- Use `Microsoft.Graph` to create a user and assign them a role in Entra ID.
- Then use `Az` to grant that user access to a resource group with `New-AzRoleAssignment`.

It's not either/or—it’s knowing when each tool is appropriate.

---

## 💡 Tips to Keep in Mind

- If you’re dealing with **subscriptions, infra, RBAC**, use `Az`.
- If you’re touching **users, groups, licenses, roles**, use `Microsoft.Graph`.
- Want automation across both? Combine them in the same script—just authenticate each separately.
