One-off user creation is fine—until you need scale, consistency, and future-proofing. That’s where Microsoft Graph comes in. In this post, I’ll walk you through how to create Microsoft Entra ID users using **PowerShell and Microsoft Graph**—with clean, scalable scripting.

## 🕰️ A (Very) Brief History of Microsoft Graph
Introduced in 2015, Microsoft Graph unified dozens of fragmented Microsoft APIs—Azure AD, Exchange, SharePoint, Teams—into a single, modern endpoint. It's now the backbone of identity and data access across Microsoft 365 and Azure services. Microsoft is phasing out older modules like AzureAD and MSOnline in favor of Graph, making it the go-to tool for cloud-native management and automation.

## 💡 Smarter Entra ID User Creation with PowerShell + Graph

Here’s how to automate Entra ID user creation using PowerShell and Microsoft Graph—with smart defaults, error handling, and dynamic group assignment. Creating users through the Azure Portal works... until it doesn’t. Once you’re dealing with onboarding, consistency, or dynamic environments, it’s time to automate. 

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before we start scripting, make sure you have:

- PowerShell 7+
- [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation)
- Admin permissions to Microsoft Entra ID

```bash
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
```

Authenticate:

```bash
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All", "Group.ReadWrite.All", "Directory.Read.All"
```

You'll get a consent prompt to grant permission the first time.

## 🛠️ Define the User Creation Function

Here’s a reusable PowerShell function that creates a user and adds them to a security group.

```bash
function New-SmartUser {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$DisplayName,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$UserPrincipalName,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$Password,
        [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]$Department,
        [Parameter()] [string]$GroupName = "Default Users"
    )

    # Create the user
    $user = New-MgUser -AccountEnabled:$true `
        -DisplayName $DisplayName `
        -MailNickname ($UserPrincipalName.Split("@")[0]) `
        -PasswordProfile @{ ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = $true; Password = $Password } `
        -UserPrincipalName $UserPrincipalName `
        -Department $Department `
        -UsageLocation "US"

    Write-Host "User '$($user.DisplayName)' created successfully."

    # Find or create the group
    $group = Get-MgGroup -Filter "displayName eq '$GroupName'" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    if (-not $group) {
        $group = New-MgGroup -DisplayName $GroupName `
            -MailEnabled:$false -MailNickname:$GroupName.Replace(" ", "") `
            -SecurityEnabled:$true -GroupTypes @()
        Write-Host "Group '$GroupName' created."
    }

    # Add user to group
    New-MgGroupMember -GroupId $group.Id -DirectoryObjectId $user.Id
    Write-Host "User added to group '$GroupName'."
}
```

## ✅ Let’s Create a User

```bash
New-SmartUser -DisplayName "Beast" `
    -UserPrincipalName "hank.mccoy@logphile.com" `
    -Password "l1n3arFus1on" `
    -Department "R&D" `
    -GroupName "Research & Development"
```

## :scroll: The Results 

```bash
C:\Users\logphile> New-SmartUser -DisplayName "Beast" `
>>     -UserPrincipalName "hank.mccoy@logphile.com" `
>>     -Password "P@ssword123!" `
>>     -Department "R&D" `
>>     -GroupName "Research & Development"
User 'Beast' created successfully.
Group 'Research & Development' created.
User added to group 'Research & Development'.
```

## 🔍 Verify in the Portal

Log into Entra ID > Users and confirm the user shows up with correct info.

Then check Groups to confirm group creation and membership.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Manual user creation introduces:

* Typos in emails or departments

* Missed group assignments

* No audit trail

* Automated creation ensures:

* Consistency

* Scalability

* Auditability

Plus, you’re scripting against Microsoft Graph—the modern way to manage Microsoft 365.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

* Make password generation secure (use New-Guid, or integrate with a vault)

* Add license assignment via New-MgUserLicense

* Export logs or send Teams alerts on creation

* Bundle into a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps

## ⚖️ Why Use PowerShell + Graph Over the Portal?

Still using the Azure Portal or legacy PowerShell modules like `AzureAD` or `MSOnline`? Reasons to change:

- **✅ Modern + Supported**: Microsoft Graph is the future; older modules are deprecated.
- **✅ Scriptable + Auditable**: Build repeatable workflows and keep them in source control.
- **✅ Richer Control**: Set attributes, assign groups, and handle edge cases the portal hides.
- **✅ Cross-Tenant Ready**: Run the same script across multiple environments without clicking around.
- **✅ Least Privilege**: Use fine-grained Graph scopes instead of over-privileged admin accounts.
- **✅ Error Handling**: Catch issues like duplicate UPNs or missing license capacity in real-time.
