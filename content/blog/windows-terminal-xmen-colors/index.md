## üß¨ Customizing Windows Terminal with X-Men Colors

After reformatting my machine recently, I took the opportunity to rebuild my terminal environment from scratch. One of the first customizations? Knock the color out so there's something to look at while you keep customizing.

If you're like me, you're old. Since you're reading this post, you're probably a nerd too. Who can forget that blue, yellow, and white color palette that dominated the 90s comics during Jim Lee‚Äôs iconic run. It was the perfect balance of bold, clean, and readable. Hopefully this Windows Terminal color scheme across the same way.

Just make sure to set your terminal profile to use **"colorScheme": "X-Men"**!
{{< /alert >}}

```powershell
$propertiesToCheck = @("Department", "JobTitle", "UsageLocation", "Manager", "MobilePhone", "OfficeLocation")
$results = @()

$users = Get-MgUser -All -Property "Id,DisplayName,UserPrincipalName,Department,JobTitle,UsageLocation,Manager,MobilePhone,OfficeLocation"

foreach ($user in $users) {
    $missingProps = @()
    foreach ($prop in $propertiesToCheck) {
        if (-not $user.$prop) {
            $missingProps += $prop
        }
    }

    if ($missingProps.Count -gt 0) {
        $results += [PSCustomObject]@{
            DisplayName = $user.DisplayName
            UserPrincipalName = $user.UserPrincipalName
            MissingProperties = ($missingProps -join ", ")
        }
    }
}


:question: Why Customize?

If you spend hours a day in the terminal, it should be a place that feels good to be in‚Äîlike Storm‚Äôs hot tub, sipping wine‚Äînot a 1v1 with Wolverine in the Danger Room. Changes that make life easier on your eyes and help create a more focused, personalized workspace add up‚Äîand should absolutely be taken advantage of.
