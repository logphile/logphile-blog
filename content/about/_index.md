**Hey, I’m Phil. This is my blog.**

In 1992 my dad bought the family a computer. Looking through the phone book, I found Paradigm BBS. Soon after, I had an email address. I discovered [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon), explored BBSes, and most importantly, learned through a dial-up connection. PC parts became my one and only ask. My friends saved up for SNES games, I saved lawn-mowing money for a 28.8k modem. It was great.

I’ve spent two decades as a sysadmin, here in Virginia and Los Angeles, one of those “jack of all trades” types. I’ve worked across stacks, made broken things work again, and kept things running quietly behind the scenes. Then I hit pause to focus on something even more important--my daughter. She came with her own version of uptime monitoring, triage, and soft skills.

Now that she’s older, I’m eager to implement and fix things again—-with fresh perspective, sharpened skills, and the same curiosity that got me into tech in the first place.
